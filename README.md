# zoom-attendance-tracker
First steps towards a graduate student automaton...

Tracks attendance in a spreadsheet by extracting data from automatically generated "Zoom Reports"


To Do:
1. Incorporate fuzzy matching using fuzzywuzzy package
2. Improve output spreadsheet formatting (set column width)
3. Remove all hardcoded paramters, possibly into .json files. Also move Alias lists to a .json dictionary.
4. Use Tkinter to create a GUI
