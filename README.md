First steps towards a graduate student automaton...

Tracks attendance in a spreadsheet by extracting data from automatically generated "Zoom Reports"


To Do:
Incorporate fuzzy matching using fuzzywuzzy package
Use Tkinter to create a GUI
Remove all hardcoded paramters, possibly into .json files. Also move Alias lists to a .json dictionary.
Improve output spreadsheet formatting (set column width)
