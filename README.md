# zoom-attendance-tracker
First steps towards a graduate student automaton...

Tracks attendance in a spreadsheet by extracting data from automatically generated "Zoom Reports." Reads classlist from a roster spreadsheet and records attendance to date columns in the roster spreadsheet.


To Do:
- [x] Incorporate fuzzy matching using fuzzywuzzy package
- [x] Improve output spreadsheet formatting (set column width, color coded conditional formatting)
- [x] Remove all hardcoded parameters, possibly into .json files.
- [ ] Make workflow independent of filenaming schemes?
- [ ] Use Tkinter to create a GUI
